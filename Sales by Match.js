//My solution:

const sockMerchant = (n, ar) => {
  let myCount = [];

  let obj = ar.reduce((colors, amount) => {
    colors[amount] = ++colors[amount] || 1;
    return colors;
  }, {});

  let count = Object.values(obj);

  for (let pairs of count) {
    myCount.push(Math.floor(pairs / 2));
  }

  return myCount.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr);
};

sockMerchant(20, [4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 4, 1, 4, 4, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 1, 4, 5, 5, 5]);
//returns: 9
